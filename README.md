# Svelte + D3 Starter Template

A starter template for the third assignment in the data visualization course at CMU. This template separated the AQI chart into a component and moves the data loading to the main page. This separation of concerns will help you simplify your code.

## Live Demo

The project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to main.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
